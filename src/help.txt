shot v%s
Takes screenshots of your desktop.

Available options

    -h, --help          shows this help.
    -o, --output PATH   saves the target image in PATH. The default file name
                        is of the form yyyymmdd_hhiiss_rrr.png, where "r" is a
                        random character (example: 20150721_103014_ukd.png).
                        If the PATH ends with /, it will be appended with
                        default file name. Target directory needs to exist
                        prior to invocation.
                        Currently, only PNG format is supported.
        --list          Lists all monitors and exits.

Options specific to screenshot regions

    By default, the region is equivalent to --desktop.

    -r, --region REGION take region from string. REGION needs to be of form
                        WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y or WIDTHxHEIGHT.
    -m, --monitor NUM   take region from NUM-th monitor.
    -d, --desktop       take region from the area bounding all monitors.
    -w, --window        take region from the currently active window.
    -i, --interactive   create a resizable and movable window, whose final
                        position and size will be used to derive the region.

Controlling interactive region picker

    The interactive region picker's window can be moved with left mouse button
    and resized with right mouse button. Following keyboard shortcuts are also
    available:

        h, left             move left by DELTA
        k, up               move up by DELTA
        j, down             move down by DELTA
        l, right            move right by DELTA

        ctrl+h, ctrl+left   shrink horizontally by DELTA
        ctrl+k, ctrl+up     shrink vertically by DELTA
        ctrl+j, ctrl+down   grow horizontally by DELTA
        ctrl+l, ctrl+right  grow vertically by DELTA

        esc, q              cancel (exit without taking a screenshot)
        enter               confirm selection

    DELTA is 25px and 1px when shift key is pressed.

    The interactive region starts with a 640x480 rectangle centered on the
    primary monitor by default. The initial size and location of interactive
    picker can be controlled by prepending other region arguments before -i.
    For example, "shot -w -i" will create interactive region picker whose
    initial location and size is set to that of the currently focused window.
