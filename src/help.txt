Usage: shot [options]
Takes screenshots of your desktop.

Basic options

    -h, --help          Shows this help.
    -o, --output PATH   Saves the target image in PATH. The default file name
                        is of the form "yyyymmdd_hhiiss_rrr.png", where "r" is
                        a random character (example: 20150721_103014_ukd.png).
                        If the PATH ends with /, it will be appended with
                        default file name. Target directory needs to exist
                        prior to invocation.
                        Currently, only PNG format is supported.
        --list          Lists all monitors and exits.
    -v, --version       Shows shot's version and exists.

Options specific to screenshot regions

    By default, the region is equivalent to --desktop.

    -r, --region REGION Takes region from string. REGION needs to be of form
                        WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y or WIDTHxHEIGHT.
    -m, --monitor NUM   Takes region from NUM-th monitor.
    -d, --desktop       Takes region from the area bounding all monitors.
    -w, --window        Takes region from the currently active window.
    -i, --interactive   Creates a resizable and movable window, whose final
                        position and size will be used to derive the region.

Controlling interactive region picker

    The interactive region picker's window can be moved with left mouse button
    and resized with right mouse button. Following keyboard shortcuts are also
    available:

        h, left             Moves left by DELTA.
        k, up               Moves up by DELTA.
        j, down             Moves down by DELTA.
        l, right            Moves right by DELTA.

        ctrl+h, ctrl+left   Shrink horizontally by DELTA.
        ctrl+k, ctrl+up     Shrink vertically by DELTA.
        ctrl+j, ctrl+down   Grow horizontally by DELTA.
        ctrl+l, ctrl+right  Grow vertically by DELTA.

        esc, q              Cancels (exits without taking a screenshot).
        enter               Confirms selection and takes a screenshot.

    DELTA is equal to 25px and 1px when shift key is pressed.

    By default, the interactive region picker starts with a 640x480 rectangle
    centered on the primary monitor. This can be controlled by prepending other
    region arguments before -i. For example, "shot -w -i" will create
    interactive region picker whose initial location and size is set to that of
    the currently focused window.

Examples

    shot -w --output=/home/sseagal/
